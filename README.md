### Background
In my sophomore year of college I took three courses that would change the way I viewed computer science forever: Computer Architecture and Organization, Systems Programming, and Operating Systems.

Computer Architecture and Orgranization was taught with C and ARM assembly, the latter of which I quickly grew to enjoy. Its simplicity made it easy to trace problems/bugs, but I will never forget spending three days on an error caused by using an incorrect register for parameter passing. Truly the lowpoint of my career.

Systems Programming and Operating Systems were taught entirely in C. I enjoyed using C and I enjoyed learning about OS theory and implementation so much, I decided I wanted to build my own OS from scratch using the knowledge I gained from these two courses. I've had a Raspberry Pi 4 laying around so... I knew what I had to do.

I had wanted to build an OS since I was in high school, making command-line RPGs with Java, webapps with Python, and silly websites with HTML, but learning C and assembly were things I didn't think I could do. Now I've learned what I needed to. Now it's time to fulfill my destiny.

I'd always wanted to name my OS "Charlemagne". I just think the name the sounds cool. Coincidentally my OS professor was French. Funny how things work out sometimes.

### What is the purpose of Charlemagne?
Fun. I want to apply what I learned and truly challenge myself in a way I don't think I ever have before.
