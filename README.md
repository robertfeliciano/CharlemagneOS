### Background
In my sophomore year of university I took a course that would completely change how I view computer science: Operating Systems. This project is my way to apply what I learned and truly challenge myself in a way I don't think I ever have before. Also, maybe people in a situation similar to mine will find this repository helpful in learning more about operating systems.

### Resources
Of course, I didn't begin this project without ever viewing small operating systems' code first. I've read some Minix code but most of the help has come from people on GitHub and elsewhere online that had similar ideas to me. With this I was able to learn how to layout/structure files and directories. Aside from online resources, my assignments in my operating systems class were instrumental in giving me a first step forward in understanding kernel code and how such a powerful OS like Linux is structured, but unfortunately I am not allowed to post them online.

### My Working Environment
I have a Raspberry Pi 4 to test my OS with. Sometimes I'll use QEMU for quick updates/tests. I mostly develop on my Dell XPS 15, running Fedora Linux, but also use an Ubuntu VM on my desktop PC.

Please see the [resources](https://github.com/robertfeliciano/CharlemagneOS/blob/main/.resources.md) file to see all the resources I consulted, grouped according to how they helped me.
